## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Make sure the MongoDB server is running on your machine)

## Getting Started
